Filling out forms, clicking buttons, and navigating pages
Developing automation projects with real-life examples

What is Selenium?
It is an open-source web automation tool
It programmatically controls browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
Selenium WebDriver: Communicates directly with the browser

- To fetch pages loaded with JavaScript
- For actions like filling out forms or clicking buttons
- For automate browser-based tests
